Fourteen and 15-year-olds will be allowed to have accounts with parental consent.                    In addition to restricting social media accounts for children, the legislation also places restrictions on pornographic websites.                    The bill, known as HB 3, requires age verification for those who visit sexually explicit websites. HB 3 goes into effect on January 1, 2025.                                                                       NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 31: In this photo illustration, a teenager uses her mobile phone to access social media on January 31, 2024 in New York City. Technology executives appeared at a Senate hearing to address accusations that their companies are endangering children's lives by not adequately policing predators and others who seek to harm and exploit young social media users.

States including Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Ohio and Utah have pushed similar bills to regulate tech platforms. In February, a federal judge temporarily blocked Ohio’s law over concerns about its breadth and the likelihood that it could infringe on teens’ First Amendment rights to access information online. And last year, another federal judge temporarily blocked Arkansas’ law.                    DeSantis vetoed a prior version of the Florida law after saying he wanted to ensure that any legislation provides parents with enough of an opportunity to be involved in decisions about their kids’ social media use.

"                                    CNN                              A New York state judge on Monday denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against several social media companies alleging the platforms contributed to the radicalization of a gunman who killed 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York in 2022, court documents show.                    “The Court has determined the complaint sufficiently pleads viable causes of action to go forward at this stage of the litigation,” said Erie County Supreme Court Justice Paula Feroleto.                    In her decision, the judge said that the plaintiffs may proceed with their lawsuit, which claims social media companies  like Meta, Alphabet, Reddit and 4chan  ”profit from the racist, antisemitic, and violent material displayed on their platforms to maximize user engagement,” including the time then 18-year-old Payton Gendron spent on their platforms viewing that material.                    Attorneys for the social media companies named in the lawsuit filed a motion to dismiss saying the companies are akin to message boards containing third-party content, court documents show.                    “However, plaintiffs contend the defendants’ platforms are more than just message boards,” the court document says.  “They allege they are sophisticated products designed to be addictive to young users and they specifically directed Gendron to further platforms or postings that indoctrinated him with ‘white replacement theory’,” the decision read.                    “It is far too early to rule as a matter of law that the actions, or inaction, of the social media/internet defendants through their platforms require dismissal,” said the judge.                    CNN has reached out to Meta for comment.                    YouTube Spokesperson José Castañeda provided a statement to CNN expressing sympathy for the victims and families of the attack and saying that YouTube has invested in technology and policies to identify and remove extremist content.                    “While we disagree with today’s decision and will be appealing, we will continue to work with law enforcement, other platforms, and civil society to share intelligence and best practices,” the statement said.                    In a statement to CNN, Reddit said, “Hate and violence have no place on Reddit. Our sitewide policies explicitly prohibit content that promotes hate based on identity or vulnerability, as well as content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or group of people. We are constantly evaluating ways to improve our detection and removal of this content, including through enhanced image-hashing systems, and we will continue to review the communities on our platform to ensure they are upholding our rules.”                    Reddit plans to appeal the decision, a spokesperson confirmed.                    CNN’s Olesya Dmitracova contributed to this report                    "
"                                    CNN                              For doctors like Eileen Barrett, a pending Supreme Court case challenging the government’s ability to communicate with social media companies isn’t principally a fight about the fraught politics of online speech.                    Instead, they say, it’s a matter of life and death.                    “I have seen countless statements that are at best problematic and at worst flat-out disinformation that I’m terribly fearful are causing harm to patients,” said Barrett, who chairs the board of regents of the American College of Physicians. “We’ve all taken care of somebody who has died from the flu. And now we’ve all taken care of people who have died from Covid.”                    Biden administration officials have for years persuaded social media platforms such as Facebook and X to take down posts that include misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things.                    But the Supreme Court must now decide whether those efforts go too far – when the government, in other words, veers into censorship on social media that violates the First Amendment.                    The case could prove pivotal to the 2024 election. Its outcome could determine whether the Department of Homeland Security can legally flag posts to social media companies that may be the work of foreign disinformation agents seeking to disrupt the race. Blocking that line of communication would undo years of collaboration that began as a response to bombshell revelations that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 US elections.                    Republican officials in two states – Missouri and Louisiana – and five social media users sued over the practice in 2022, arguing that the White House did far more than “persuade” the tech giants to take down a few deceptive posts. Instead, they say, the Biden administration engaged in an informal, backdoor campaign of coercion to silence voices it disagreed with  a practice known as “jawboning.”                    They say the decision by social media companies to suppress coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop in late 2020 is evidence of the type of unconstitutional government influence they are challenging. The plaintiffs also say the FBI leaned on platforms to remove content it identified as “foreign” when the posts were actually written by Americans.                    “The result of this was to silence entire narratives,” said Jenin Younes, litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a legal advocacy group that frequently challenges government regulations and that is representing the private plaintiffs in the case. “Policies were adopted without the public hearing those views and that’s exactly why we have a First Amendment, so the government can’t do stuff like that.”          Supreme Court in the middle of social media and free speech intersection                Oral arguments in the case, Murthy v. Missouri, arrive at a moment when courts and policymakers are grappling with the power of social media to influence everything from a patient’s medical decisions to the outcome of a presidential election. At times the debates around social media have prompted bipartisan responses, such as legislation approved by the House on Wednesday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok.                    But legal fights over social media at the Supreme Court this year have taken on a partisan hue.                    The high court is also considering state laws approved by Florida and Texas designed to stop social media giants from throttling conservative views. Those laws are being challenged by a trade group representing social media firms that has claimed they trample over the companies’ First Amendment rights.                    The First Amendment bars government-imposed restrictions on free speech. That prohibition doesn’t extend to private entities like Facebook, which are free to make whatever decisions about content they choose.                    But the Supreme Court has ruled in past decisions that private entities can become “state actors,” and be subject to First Amendment scrutiny, when the government compels them to take action.                    The administration argues it did not compel platforms to do anything because, it says, it never threatened social media companies with negative consequences if they refused to heed its advice.                    “Government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they speak in public or in private to inform, to persuade, or to criticize speech by others,” the US government wrote in a brief.                    Testimony in the case by an FBI official showed that social media companies frequently made their own decisions about how to handle input from the government. In many situations, the official testified, companies flat-out ignored the government’s flags or suggestions about content that appeared to violate their own terms of service.                    Internal communications related to Twitter’s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story also highlighted how high-level company officials were divided on whether to suppress coverage of the story, contrary to suggestions by some critics that social media platforms demoted it because of government pressure or their own ideological bias.                    “The government has no authority to threaten platforms into censoring protected speech,” said Alex Abdo with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “But it must have the ability to participate in public discourse so that it can effectively govern and inform the public of its views.”          Conservative judges have sided with challengers thus far                A federal judge in Louisiana who initially reviewed the case blocked the White House and a slew of federal agencies from communicating with social media companies about removing content in a sweeping preliminary injunction last year.                    A three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals scaled back the injunction last fall, narrowing its scope to a few agencies it said likely violated the First Amendment: the White House, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI.                    After the Biden administration filed an emergency appeal last year, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the injunction – in other words, allowing federal officials to continue the communications – and agreed to hear the case.                    Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they disagreed with that decision.                    “At this time in the history of our country, what the court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news,” Alito wrote. “That is most unfortunate.”                    The dispute has drawn interest from state and county election officials who are worried about a decision that might limit their ability to fight election disinformation. In a separate brief, media organizations warn of a “chilling of the free flow of information” if the court rules broadly for the plaintiffs. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has opposed Covid-19 vaccines and policies intended to reduce the spread of the virus, tried to intervene in the case but was denied.                    A ruling against the US government would threaten research and speech by independent watchdogs and discourage vital work to secure America’s elections, according to civil rights advocates.                    “Information sharing between and among government agencies, voting rights organizations, and social media companies is crucial in guarding against emerging threats, particularly to vulnerable communities,” a trio of prominent civil rights groups wrote in a filing.                    From the doctors’ perspective, the trends around vaccine hesitancy are moving in the wrong direction. Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, blames misinformation on social media as a big part of the reason why.                    The medical groups, which are supporting the Biden administration, were represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, a left-leaning legal advocacy group.                     “We have to deal day in and day out with the ramifications of myths and disinformation around health issues, in general, but specifically about vaccines,” said Hoffman, a practicing pediatrician in Oregon. “While our concern is not necessarily the crux of the Supreme Court case, the impact is really, really significant.”                    "
"                              Paris      CNN                              Hugo Travers may not think of himself as a journalist, but he could be the most popular one in France.                    Travers, 26, is the founder and face of HugoDecrypte, a French media start-up that delivers news aimed primarily at young audiences. What began eight years ago as a university student’s YouTube channel now boasts 14 million followers across its social media accounts, 200 million monthly views on TikTok and another 35 million on YouTube.                    HugoDecrypte’s Instagram account has more followers than Le Monde, the French daily widely considered the country’s newspaper of record, as well as BFMTV and France24, arguably the two most popular 24-hour news networks in France. And its daily news update is the most downloaded podcast in the country, according to media monitor ACPM.                    “What’s very special is the fact that I really started as a YouTuber and I consider myself really as a YouTuber,” Travers told CNN in an interview last month.                    Whatever you call him, there’s no denying that Travers has created something that resonates with young audiences shunning traditional media in France, where mistrust of the news industry runs deeper than in much of the rest of Europe.                    “He is seen as a very reliable source for news,” said Alice Antheaume, vice-dean at the Sciences Po Journalism School.                    Given the YouTube channel’s dominance among the coveted age 15 to 34 demographic, most major politicians in France, including President Emmanuel Macron, have sat down with Travers to reach a younger audience. Travers hosted nearly all of the candidates running for president in 2022.                    While Macron went on to win re-election, he has struggled to maintain support among younger voters as his agenda has become more conservative. In January, Macron appointed 34-year-old Gabriel Attal as the country’s youngest-ever prime minister and tasked him with revitalizing his government.                                           Travers, right, interviewed French President Emmanuel Macron last year.          Marie Flament/HugoDécrypte                    HugoDecrypte’s 10-minute news digest is posted weekdays on YouTube and audio platforms. It typically features the Franco-British Travers, often casually dressed, delivering explainer-style summaries from behind a desk, alongside animations or stock video.                    Francois Jost, an emeritus professor at Sorbonne Nouvelle University in Paris and expert on the French media, said the channel’s “great use of images” appealed to young people.                    Though the HugoDecrypte team doesn’t shy away from the biggest news of the day, it often looks to its audiences for guidance in choosing the lead story. Mental health issues are frequently the first story covered, as are conflicts less often in the media spotlight, such as those in Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo.                    “What we’re building, since day one, is something serious in terms of news, in terms of its journalistic approach,” Travers said. “Of course, the format is different.”          A Chromebook and an idea                When Travers launched the channel eight years ago, all he had was a Chromebook without editing software.                    He had gumption and experience, though. As a precocious middle school student, Travers started a website with friends, for which he covered local sports and news in the suburb he grew up in, west of Paris.                    By 2015, Travers was studying at Sciences Po, a prestigious university in Paris. The idea for his YouTube channel came from two realizations.                                           Travers' daily news round-ups, usually delivered from behind a desk, are very popular among younger French audiences.          Joshua Berlinger/CNN                    The first concerned the state of political coverage in French media. Travers had been interested in politics for years  yet when he and his friends turned on political debates on television, they could barely understand what was being discussed, he recalled.                    Travers also thought about how he consumed content: like much of Gen Z, he was spending hours on YouTube. He had go-to channels for history and science but no preferred source for journalism in French.                    The HugoDecrypte channel launched with the mission to give young French audiences a fast, digestible way to understand the news. Travers’ goal was to create accessible, in-depth videos that wouldn’t pander to younger audiences nor assume too much prior knowledge. Then he’d publish them directly to social media.                                           HugoDecrypte boasts 14 million followers across social media platforms.           Joshua Berlinger/CNN                    “My generation spends so much time on YouTube,” he said. “You’ve got to create content where people are … If I spend time on YouTube or Instagram, why would I not get informed on YouTube or Instagram?”                    Seeking growth, Travers decided to hire staffers. Benjamin Aleberteau, a recent graduate, became HugoDecrypte’s first employee in January 2019; today he’s editor-in-chief. HugoDecrypte has expanded to a team of about 25 employees working out of a modern office at the end of a cobblestone alley in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Their newsroom reflects their target audience  there’s a video game console in the kitchen, a dog roams the halls and everyone appears to be in their 20s.                    Beyond the world of politics, Travers’ in-depth interviews have also become a valued stop for anyone promoting a film, book or TV series to the Francophone world. He hosted Christopher Nolan over the summer to discuss then-﻿Oscar frontrunner “Oppenheimer” and Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya ahead of the “Dune” sequel’s release. Travers has also counted Francophone celebrities like Angele, Omar Sy, Tahar Rahim and Virginie Efira among his guests.                    HugoDecrypte’s success is notable considering the bleak state of the French news media landscape. Like their English-language counterparts, French news outlets face declining advertising revenue, the spread of misinformation and increasing mistrust in the media.                    Many anglophone outlets have turned to subscription-based revenue models to survive. But in France, just 11% of people surveyed pay for news, according to the Reuters Institute.                                            HugoDecrypte went from a one-man operation eight years ago to a team of 25 people today.           Joshua Berlinger/CNN                    Both Jost at Sorbonne Nouvelle University and Antheaume at the Sciences Po Journalism School pointed out that HugoDecrypte often hews toward explanatory journalism, content that is cheaper and quicker to create than original reporting.                    Travers sees the two as complementary, saying that HugoDecrypte is looking into partnerships with traditional news or investigative outlets. Meanwhile, HugoDecrypte makes money via advertising, partnerships and sponsored content.                    Travers attributes the brand’s success to the channel’s original mission: producing accessible content. That means no paywall and interacting directly with younger audiences on social media.          Building trust                To reach Gen Z, HugoDecrypte launched on TikTok earlier than most French media.                    “TikTok was, at least in France, seen as this thing for teenagers … basically with dancing and challenges,” Travers said. “But it’s still a platform where there’s millions of young people, and those young people, I’m convinced that they’re interested in news and in politics.”                    Trust is also a key factor. The French public has grown increasingly skeptical of newspapers and television stations owned by billionaires like Xavier Niel or Vincent Bollore, whose conservative media empire is often compared to that of Rupert Murdoch.                    Travers told CNN he decided early against raising capital, a decision he believes has allowed the operation to grow at a sustainable pace.                    Then there’s personification. Tying the brand to Travers’ name and likeness has, some experts say, allowed him to inspire a degree of confidence among young audiences who don’t consume traditional media.                    “Audiences are more likely to trust individuals than media brands, especially on social media. HugoDecrypte fits perfectly with this need,” said Antheaume.                    And, unlike many high-profile anglophone news personalities, Travers has worked hard to keep his opinions out of the public view.                    HugoDecrypte has been able to capitalize on several trends in the French news industry. While the brand is starting to branch out into English- and Spanish-language content, it’s not clear if the model itself will translate successfully.                    Travers acknowledges the challenges inherent in building a cross-cultural brand. But he and editor-in-chief Aleberteau believe that, wherever there is social media, their model is viable.                    “In any country there’s a need for information. And in any country, there are young people who want to be informed,” Aleberteau said.                    "
"                              New York      CNN                              The always-online generation may be starting to unplug a bit.                    Around 40% of teenagers say they have cut back on their time on social media, according to a report published Monday by the Pew Research Center. Nearly the same proportion of teens acknowledge that they spend “too much” time on their smartphones 38% and social media 27%.                    The findings come as concerns about the potential harm from social media to young users’ mental health and well-being continue to escalate among parents, schools and lawmakers. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that he believes 13, the minimum age to sign up for many platforms, is too young for children to be on social media. And several US states have attempted to pass legislation that aims to keep teens under the age of 16 off social media  although such laws have faced fierce legal opposition.                    Monday’s Pew report indicates that some teens may be taking matters into their own hands by setting stricter boundaries around their tech use.                    All but 5% of US teens now have access to a smartphone and a separate Pew study from December found that one third of teens say they use at least one of the five major social media platforms  YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram or Facebook  “almost constantly.”                                                                                 Maskot/Getty Images                        Related article      Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows                          According to Monday’s report, teen girls, who some believe are especially at risk of impacts to their mental health and body image from social media, are more likely to say they spend too much time on their phones 44% than teen boys 33%.                    Still, the majority of teens of all ages 51% believe they use their smartphones “about the right amount.”                    “Teens who report spending too much time on social media and smartphones are especially likely to report cutting back on each,” the report states.                    To conduct the report, Pew surveyed 1,453 U.S. teenagers ages 13 to 17 and their parents between September 26 and October 23, 2023.                    The survey also questioned teens about the feelings they experience when they go without their phones: 72% of teen respondents said they “sometimes” or “often” feel happy when they set down the screens. However, some revealed mixed emotions, as 44% of the teens surveyed said they feel anxious when they’re without their phones.                    Still, the report notes that “a minority of teens – ranging from 7% to 32% – say they often feel” anxious, upset or lonely when they’re “phone-less.”                    And more than two thirds of teens say they believe the benefits of smartphones outweigh the harms for people their age. “More teens believe smartphones make it easier, rather than harder, to be creative, pursue hobbies and do well in school,” the report states.                    A larger portion of the teen respondents 42%, however, said they believed smartphones make it harder to learn good social skills.                    The American Psychological Association last year recommended that teens undergo training before they start using social media, saying the tools are “neither inherently harmful nor beneficial” for young people but that they should have instruction in social media literacy and psychological development to minimize potential harms.                    Many parents also say they are keeping tabs on their teens’ smartphone and social media use, with half of parent respondents reporting they’ve looked through their children’s phones, particularly parents of younger teens. And in most cases, their children seem to know it: 43% of teen respondents said their parents had looked through their phones.                    Parents these days have more tools than ever to monitor their kids’ online experience. Many social media platforms have responded to criticisms over youth safety by launching so-called family centers and other features to allow parents to oversee how their teens are using the platforms, while maintaining some privacy for their kids.
